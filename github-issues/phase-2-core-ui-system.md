# [Flutter Migration] Phase 2: Core UI System Migration

## Overview
Migrate the core UI system from React/shadcn/ui to Flutter Material Design components with custom theming.

## Tasks

### âœ… 2.1 Design System Implementation
- [x] Create Flutter equivalent of shadcn/ui components:
  - `CustomButton` (equivalent to Button with CVA variants)
  - `CustomDialog` (modal dialogs with overlay)
  - `CustomTabs` (tabbed interface system)
  - `CustomCard` with specialized variants (elevated, outline, flat)
  - Icon system with `CustomIcon` and `CustomIconButton`
- [x] Implement dynamic theming system equivalent to ThemeContext
- [x] Create CSS variables equivalent using Flutter themes
- [x] Set up responsive design patterns

### âœ… 2.2 Icon and Asset System
- [x] Migrate from Lucide React to `lucide_flutter` package
- [x] Set up asset management for images and fonts
- [x] Configure custom fonts (Inter font family)
- [x] Implement comprehensive icon system with `AppIcons` catalog
- [x] Create window control buttons (macOS style)

### âœ… 2.3 Animation System
